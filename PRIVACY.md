# Privacy Policy for Perplexity Search Extension

**Last updated: [Enter Today's Date]**

This Privacy Policy describes how the "Perplexity Search" Chrome Extension ("the Extension") handles your information.

## No Data Collection

The Extension is designed with your privacy in mind. We do not collect, store, share, or transmit any of your personal data.

The only information the Extension interacts with is the text you manually highlight on a webpage. This text is used solely to create a search query and is sent directly to Perplexity's search engine when you choose to initiate a search. This information is processed ephemerally and is never seen, stored, or logged by the Extension or its developer.
